I"Ä<p>Sooner or later, as an API evolve, you may have to introduce a dreaded ‚Äúbreaking change‚Äù.
But what is it actually? Should you always be fearful of it? And how to deal with it?</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-breaking-change">What is a breaking change</h1>

<p>A breaking change is non backward-compatible modification requiring all of consumers of an API to update their code in order to use the modified API.
There are many different ways to introduce breaking changes in APIs, some are obvious, some are not.</p>

<p>The most common obvious way to introduce a breaking is to rename or remove something in the interface contract.
Rename <code>GET /usrs</code> to <code>GET /users</code> or remove the <code>isAdmin</code> property from the User data model and there‚Äôs a huge risk that it will break some if not all of the API‚Äôs consumers.
But there are also less obvious interface contract‚Äôs breaking changes. Turning an optional parameter into a required one or adding new values to enumerations that consumer is supposed to interpret.</p>
