I"P<p>In (Ch-ch-) Changes, David Bowie sang “Every time I thought I’d got it made, it seemed the taste was not so sweet”, that’s a good metaphor for API design.
An API will irremediably evolve because it will lack some features or because of mistakes, and so sooner or later, you may have to introduce a “breaking change”.
That’s usually when people start to run in circle, scream and shout “Oh! Please no! Please, not a breaking ch-ch-change”.
But, what is it actually? How to handle it? And should you always be afraid of it?</p>

<h1 id="what-is-a-breaking-change">What is a breaking change</h1>

<p>A breaking change is non backward-compatible modification that requires consumers to modify their code in order to continue using an API (or at least modify the part of their code using the modified part of the API).
There are many different ways to introduce breaking changes in APIs, some are obvious, some are not.</p>

<p>The most common obvious way to introduce a breaking is to rename or remove something in the interface contract.
Rename <code>GET /usrs</code> to <code>GET /users</code> or remove the <code>isAdmin</code> property from the User data model and there’s a huge risk that it will break some if not all of the API’s consumers.
But there are also less obvious interface contract’s breaking changes. Turning an optional parameter into a required one or adding new values to enumerations that consumer is supposed to interpret.</p>

<p>But there are less obvious and far more treacherous breaking changes:</p>

<p>Pushing the concept to the extreme, that means some consumers could depend on an API’s long response time and optimizing the API’s implementation to make things go faster on provider’s side could put them at risk.
That’s probably going a little bit too far, but keep that in mind, just in case.</p>
