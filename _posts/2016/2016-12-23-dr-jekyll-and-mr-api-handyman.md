ICYMI, I've just switched from a self hosted Wordpress to a Jekyll static website hosted on Github. The code is available in the [apihandyman.io repository](https://github.com/arno-di-loreto/apihandyman.io). If you're looking for information and tips about how to enable pagination on categories pages and have infinite scroll with Jekyll or how to to deploy a Jekyll website using custom plugins on Github Pages, you should take a look at it.
